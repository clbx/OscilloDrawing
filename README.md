# OscilloDrawing

A processing app that displays input given in a processing windows on an Oscilloscope in XY mode


This is based off a project done by Tyler Bletsch [here](https://discspace.org/draw-anything-on-an-oscilloscope/). While it was a good proof of concept, it was never a real finished project and required 3 different programs (in 3 different languages) and copying and pasting arrays into Arduino code. However it was extremely useful in getting this project off the ground due to my relative inexperience with processing.
